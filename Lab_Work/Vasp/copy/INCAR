### Electronic Part ###
ALGO    = F        ! Electronic minimisation algorithm: Normal (IALGO=38 Davidson), Fast (Davidson+RMM-DIIS), Very_Fast (RMM-DIIS, for MD)
NELMIN  = 6        ! Minimum number of electronic SC steps (def.=2 but increase for MD or relaxation)
EDIFF   = 1E-5     ! Global break condition for the electronic SC-loop (MD calculations: do not use default (too large drift) 1E-4 but 1E-5)
MAXMIX  = 40       ! Maximum number of vectors stored in the Broyden/Pulay mixer (reduce the number of electronic iterations for MD's and ionic relaxations)
##############################
### Ionic Part ###
IBRION  = 2        ! How the ions are moved (0--> MD, 1--> close to the local minimum, 2--> difficult relaxation problems, 3--> bad initial guesses, -1--> no update of ions)
NSW     = 1000      ! Maximum number of ionic step
POTIM   = 0.5      ! Time step in fs for IBRION=0, otherwise scaling constant for the forces (important choice when IBRION=1)
EDIFFG  = -0.01    ! Global break condition for the ionic loop (MD calculations: do not consider this parameter)
NBLOCK  = 1        ! Pair correlation function and the DOS are calculated every NBLOCK ionic steps (Def. = 1)
##SMASS  = 2        ! Controls the velocities (-3 --> NVE, >0 --> NVT : value determines frequency of coupling to heat bath (Nos√© mass value)
##TEBEG  = 300      ! Temperature during MD calculations

### Others considerations ###
ISYM    = 0        ! No symmetry considerations
ISTART  = 0        ! Starting from scratch (when WAVECAR does not exist)
PREC    = NORMAL   ! Precision of the calculations (could be set to LOW for MD calculations after tests)
ENCUT   = 520       ! Cut-off energy for plane wave basis set in eV

GGA     = ML
LUSE_VDW = .TRUE.
Zab_vdW = -1.8867
AGGAC = 0.0000
LASPH = .TRUE.

ISPIN   = 1        ! (1) non-spin polarized (2) spin polarized
LREAL   = AUTO     ! Projected wavefunction character in real space + fully automatic optimization of projection operator
NWRITE  = 1        ! What will be written in OUTCAR (0 or 1 minimum, 2 default, 4 debugging)
LWAVE   =.FALSE.   ! IF orbitals (WAVECAR) are written
LCHARG  =.FALSE.   ! IF charge densities (CHGCAR and CHG) are written
ISMEAR  = 0        ! Gaussian smearing (good for semiconductors or insulators with low kpoints)
SIGMA   = 0.1      ! Width of the smearing in eV
NCORE   = 8        ! Number of cores per node
