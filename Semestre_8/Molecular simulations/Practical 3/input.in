# Parameters of the simulation:
#
336    NumberOfParticles 336
6000  Nsteps = Total number of simulation steps
3000     Nsteps_equil = Number of steps which are discarded when computing averages
-3      Nsteps_rescale = Number of steps of velocity rescaling (or -1: all steps; -2: Berendsen thermostat; -3: Bussi thermostat)
1      Do an energy minimization first? (0=NO, 1=YES).
1      Temperature (in reduced LJ units). Used only when velocity rescaling is turned on!
0.001  Time step   (in reduced LJ units)
0.8    Density     (in reduced LJ units)
0     Startup Configuration (0=random, 1=simple cubic lattice, 2=hcp lattice)
